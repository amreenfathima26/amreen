Project Idea
This app can send messages to other users. For simplicity we can use firebase for database ans concentrate on security and architecture of the app.
We can practice MVVM, Dagger-hilt/Koin, Room DB, Video players and a bit of UI elements with animation.
It might seem an easy project but while you make it, it will be a great learning and a good learning arc will be there if you grow it more cause you can extend it to a great extent.

Usage:
The app sends messages to friends as well as photos. It gives the user online/offline and last seen features. And, for chat pagination is used such that it only show 10 messages at a time. The user can change the display profile picture and can change status.
