# Resistor Colour Code Calculator

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

Resistor values are represented by colour bands on the body of the resistor. Each band has a numerical value e.g Brown=1, Red=2. The calulator will allow you to select each of the colour bands and will then calculate and show the value of the resistor. A resistor can have 3, 4, 5 or 6 bands. Initially only up to five bands will be considered.

Three Band - Band 1 = Value  Band 2 = Value  Band 3 = Multiplier
Four Band - Band 1 = Value  Band 2 = Value  Band 3 = Muliplier  Band 4 = Tolerance
Five Band - Band 1 = Value  Band 2 = Value  Band 3 = Value Band 4 = Multiplier  Band 5 = Tolerance

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can select up to 6 colour bands to represent the value of that band
-   [ ] User can view the calulated resistor value based on the colour bands selected
-   [ ] User can view the minimum and maximum values calculated based on the selected tolerance for the resistor

## Bonus features

-   [ ] User should be able to enter the numeric value of the resistor and the app will return the colour code
-   [ ] Add sixth band
