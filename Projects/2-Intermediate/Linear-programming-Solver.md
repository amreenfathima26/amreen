# Linear Programming Solver App

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

Linear Programming is a mathematical method that is used in Food and agriculture, Engineering, Energy Industry and Transportation etc in order to find the optimal solution. Linear Programming problems consist of Objective Function and Constrains. This Application helps to maximize or minimize the given objective function using given constrains.
