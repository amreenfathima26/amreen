It is rare to see projects built with object-oriented programming pattern in Javascript with localStorage especially when you're just starting out.

- The aim of the book list project is to give developers and learners the opportunity to build an app in object-oriented pattern using ES5 & ES6 syntax while learning javascript. It will also teach developers how to implement localStorage in javascript.
- The project Uses Skeleton CSS for styling but feel free to use any other library you prefer...be creative and make it the way you want it to be.
