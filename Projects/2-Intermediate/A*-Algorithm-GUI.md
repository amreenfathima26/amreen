# A* Algorithm

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

The A* Algorithm is very popular graph search algorithm especially in game developement. Unlike Djikstra or Breadth First Search,
A* algorithm is an informed path finding algorithm. You can learn more about it here:

The project should have a graphical interface where there are:
- A Starting point
- A End point
- Obstacles

The purpose of the app is to find the shortest path from the starting point to the end point by implimenting the A* algorithm

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can change the starting and end point
-   [ ] User can add or delete obstacles
