# SIMULinho

**Tier:** 1-Intermediate

The Project aims to create a graphical interface that controls the synthesis/simulation of a RISC-V microcontroller encoded using HDL Verilog. With this interface, Estudande will be able to visualize the internal processes of the microcontroller, such as changing registers, clock status of the main flags of the simulation, in addition to inserting and changing the data and program memory, so it will be able to insert new codes for tests quickly and simply .

## Necessary resources

To participate in the project, the student/maker needs to develop skills in software development using the C/C++ language and its entire universe, develop skills in the use of Qt5 in addition to the hardware synthesis tools related to Verilog language.

## User Stories

- SIMULinho is in the proof of concept phase

## Bonus features

Those involved will learn how to synthesize hardware using HDL Verilog, how to program in C/C++, Qt5 and integrate support code and analyze to iVerilog.
