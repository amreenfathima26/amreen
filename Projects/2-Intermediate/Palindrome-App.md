# Palindrome-App

**Tier:** 2-Beginner

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards. 

The purpose of this application is to check whether the given number is palindrome or not.

### Constraints

Below algorithm can be used to build the application.

- Get the user input number
- Hold the input number value in a temporary variable
- Reverse the number
- Compare the temporary number with reversed number
- If the both temporary number and reversed number are same, print 'Yes, it's a palindrome number'
- Else print 'Not a palindrome number'


## User Stories
