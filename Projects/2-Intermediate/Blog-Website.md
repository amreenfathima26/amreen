# Blog Website

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

The blog, like the To-Do app, is a classic. It’s a little more complex, but it also covers some other intriguing tasks, like having numerous parts and needing to move between them.

You’ll not only practice, but you’ll also apply what you learned about hooks in the last project to learn how to use custom hooks from third-party libraries.

In fact, react-router-dom, a package that aids in the binding of the React Router module within web applications, is given its own section.

## As part of this project, you’ll work on:

- [ ] Cloning and working with an existing project;
- [ ] React Router and how to use it to add navigation to your application;
- [ ] Using custom hooks from 3rd party libraries;
- [ ] Setting up a 404 page and what it means.
