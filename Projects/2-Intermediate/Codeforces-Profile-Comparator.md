# Codeforces-Profile-Comparator

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

Build an application which will help the user to compare two different profiles of codeforces

## User Stories

- [ ] User can enter usernames of two distinct profiles into the two different `input` fields
- [ ] User can then hit the compare button. This will call an API provided by codeforces which will return an array binded with the corresponding user. We can use that data to bind up the corresponding informations (**Current Rating**, **Max Rating**, **Min Rating**, **Total Contests**, **Best Ranks**, **Worst Rank**, etc)
- [ ] User can view the above mentioned details and can get the clear picture about the comparison

## Bonus features

- [ ] For both the users, whom we are comparing, add a link for both of them that will send the User to an external site (i.e. to their codeforces profile) which has more information about the respective user.
- [ ] Implement a Responsive Design
- [ ] Add loading animations while we fetch the data
- [ ] If we can plot a histogram for number of contests, minimum rating and maximum rating, and the graph showing rating changes from numerical data we got from the api call, it will definetly help the user to get more clarity about the comparison in an easy way.
