# Hangman Game

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

Hangman is a word puzzle game that allows the user to guess missing 
letters one at a time to solve the missing word or phrase.

A user will select a letter from A - Z on a keyboard displayed on the 
screen. If true, the selected letter will be disabled from the keyboard 
and will display in the correct spot in the word/phrase. If false, the
selected letter will be disabled from the keyboard and a piece of a
stick figure will be displayed. If the missing word/phrase is solved 
before all the pieces of the stick figure is shown you win, and vice versa.
