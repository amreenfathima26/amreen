# ASCII Art Generator

Tier 2 - Intermediate

Create an application that converts images (JPEG format) to ASCII art. Each JPEG image, or any raster image format stores a basically a set of pixels, map the pixels rgb values to brightness value. Then map the brightness value to an ASCII character to make an image into ASCII art.

You can use a library to read the images. A few suggestions are Pillow, MiniMagick, CamanJS and ImageMagick.

## User Stories

[] Read an image to rgb pixel values and convert to ASCII art.
[] Modify image and art such that it does not take too much space. (Hint: Shrink the original image before conversion)
[] Implement better brightness mapping using some knowledge of our vision.

## Bonus features

[] Convert the ASCII art to ASCII art with colors. Add themes for color sets.
[] Add toggle for invert colors feature.
[] Print images from the webcam.
