# Virtual Study Group App

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

In this beginner-friendly app development project, you'll create a Virtual Study Group app that connects students studying similar subjects. 
This app will facilitate collaboration on projects, sharing of notes, and organization of study sessions. 
It's an excellent way to dive into app development while solving a practical problem for students.


### Constraints

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can create an account and set up their profile with details such as name, school/college, major, and areas of interest.
-   [ ] User can join or create study groups based on subjects or topics they are studying. Each study group should have a name, description, and list of members.

## Bonus features
