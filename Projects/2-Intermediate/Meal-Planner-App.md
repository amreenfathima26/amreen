# Meal Planner & Shopping List Generator

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate
The purpose of this application is to make meal-planning and shopping much easier! This app allows users to input recipes that they like, with clear instructions and accurate ingrdients. User should also be able to enter relevant information about what can be bought from supermarkets (eg, 100g of cheese). The app will whip up a weekly/bi-weekly (user choice!) meal plan with shopping list to make life much easier. It'll take into account shopping quantities and be sure to bundle meals together so you will use up that entire 100g of cheese. No more food waste!

Users will need recipes of their own, and knowledge of their supermarket stock.
