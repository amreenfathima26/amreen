# Image Blending Tool

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

NFT(Non-fungible token) has been so hyped. And most of the NFTs are created using Image blending tool can be an APP, Python script, or javascript script that are able to blend the images together to create new image.
Usually creator create 1000 up to 10,000 images. They have alot of traits to blend (for example: Head, Hat, Skin color, Hair Style, etc.) and in each trait they have many variants (for example: big head, small head, medium head).

## User Stories

- [ ] User can set how many traits they want to blend.
- [ ] User can set how many images they want to generate.
- [ ] Each output image must be unique.

## Bonus Features

- [ ] User can set what type of blending they want (for example: overlay, soft-light, saturation, etc).
- [ ] User can set rarity of each variant (for example: I want golden hair rarity is rare so my image out put will have least golden hair).
- [ ] User can set random or create by order from the input images (Most programmer write the script or create an app to blend image order by name or date but this feature we want it to be random).
- [ ] Program can generate META Data for each generated image (NFT is based on metadata to display image in the platform).
