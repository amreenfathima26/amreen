# Book Finder App

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

Create an application that will ask the player questions. The player's reward for each correct question will be an amount of money that will be added. The player can always stop the game whenever he wants and the game will end with the amount of money he already has. If the player chooses to answer the next question and makes a mistake, the game will end and will be left with half the amount won. If you win, the amount will be added to the total. Each question will have 5 options and only one is correct.
