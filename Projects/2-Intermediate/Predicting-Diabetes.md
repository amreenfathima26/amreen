# Predicting Diabetes

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate


Predicting diabetes using machine learning involves the construction of a model that can effectively analyze various health indicators such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age, in order to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes. 
Popular ML libraries like scikit-learn in Python can be utilized for implementation, and platforms such as Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook can facilitate the development process.
