# Popcornflix - Movie streaming app

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

A free movie app that simplifies streaming the site's movies on your phone or tablet. 

There are certainly some things the service could improve upon, such as the quality of the movies and the methods you're able to use to find a movie to watch. For example, most movie sites let you sort the videos by popularity or release date, and sometimes even rating, but Popcornflix simply defaults to an alphabetical listing and doesn't let you change it.

All that said, it's still a nice place to visit if you're wanting to avoid paying for films.
