# MathFormular App

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

There are several ways to improve in learning Data structure and algorithm,with the MathFormular app, you will practice by taking both math and phyics formula as case study.
This method of learning data structure and algorithm isn not limed to those in Engineering Field. For example, creating an app for calcluating geometric progression or arithmetic mean of data given. As there are thousands of formulaout there, writing a simplified algorithm to make it work in order to improve the DSA skills, and this can be done in any language.


### FEATURES OF THE APP
-The app can be specific for just one formula, for instance, calculating simple interest of compound interest
-There can be optioins where user can select the formula, (for example : calculating linear regression, AP, or any other formulae)

## HOW IT WORKS
-- User will select the formula in the Option list
--The all the input must be in the right format for calculation i.e int or float
--The result should be in the right format base on the input provided.


### THE RESOURCES
 -There are several books and oline pages about math formula but this is a good start
