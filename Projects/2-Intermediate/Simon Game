Description of the Simon game :

The Simon game website serves as a digital platform for this classic memory game. It offers users a chance to test and enhance their memory, concentration, and pattern recognition skills. Whether for fun or as a cognitive exercise, the Simon game remains a timeless favorite, underpinned by the universal language of mathematics, subtly embedded in its patterns and sequences.

The game's rules are straightforward, yet they challenge the player's memory and ability to focus. It begins with a single randomly selected color/sound in the sequence, and the player must replicate it by pressing the corresponding button. If successful, the sequence extends, and the player must reiterate the entire sequence accurately. As the game progresses, it introduces longer and more complex sequences.
