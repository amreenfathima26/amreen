# Recommendation System

**Tier:** 3-Advanced

A recommendation system is an essential tool in today's digital world, allowing users to discover items based on their preferences and history. This project aims to create a recommendation system that provides personalized suggestions based on user behaviors.

### Constraints

- Recommendations should not be based solely on random criteria; they must be calculated using machine learning algorithms.
- The system must handle real data and meet performance constraints.

## User Stories

- [ ] User can create an account and log in to save their preferences.
- [ ] User can see a homepage with personalized recommendations based on their history.
- [ ] User can view details of a recommended item, including a description, rating, and similar items.

- [ ] User can share their recommendations on social media.
- [ ] User can view the history of their recommendations and interactions with the system.
