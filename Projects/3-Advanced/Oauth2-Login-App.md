# OAuth 2.0 Login App

**Tier:** 3-Advanced

Social login using OAuth 2.0 protocol in a simple web application. The application should
be divided in a API - responsible to perform the login - and a web application that will 
use this API to authenticate the users.

The ideia of this app is to exercise authentication, session management and external
services dependency. There's no need to have a fancy web application to login, since
the goal here is the authentication API working with OAuth 2.0. If you already have
a web application to integrate with, it will be a bonus.
