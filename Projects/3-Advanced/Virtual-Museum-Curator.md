**Application Name:** Virtual Museum Curator  
**Tier:** 3 - Advanced

**Description:**  
Virtual Museum Curator is an immersive web application that allows users to create, curate, and explore virtual art galleries using 3D technology. Built using Three.js and WebXR, the application offers a blend of 3D modeling, virtual reality, and art curation into a single interactive and educational platform. Users can design their own virtual galleries, upload and position artworks, and explore their creations through both web browsers and VR headsets.

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of this application is to provide users with the ability to curate virtual art galleries, allowing them to arrange and present 3D models of artworks in customizable spaces. This project is designed for art enthusiasts, curators, and educators looking for an innovative way to display and interact with art in virtual environments.

**Resources Needed:**
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- WebXR Device API for virtual reality support
- Blender (or other 3D modeling tools) for creating and importing 3D models
- AR.js for augmented reality features (optional)
  
**User Stories:**  
- User can create a new virtual gallery space by specifying dimensions and layout.  
- User can upload 3D models of artworks or use a built-in 3D model creation tool.  
- User can arrange artworks within the virtual gallery space using drag-and-drop interactions.  
- User can add informational plaques next to artworks with titles, descriptions, and artist information.  
- User can explore their created gallery in a web browser using mouse and keyboard controls.  
- User can enter a VR mode to explore the gallery using a compatible VR headset.  

**Bonus Features:**  
- User can collaborate with others in real-time to curate galleries together.  
- User can create guided tours with predetermined paths and audio narration.  
- User can incorporate AR features to project artworks into their real environment using mobile devices.  
- User can import real-world museum floor plans to recreate existing galleries virtually.
