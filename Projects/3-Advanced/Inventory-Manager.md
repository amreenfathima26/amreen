# Application Name

**Tier:** 3-Advanced

While this doesn't sound like the most interesting project at first you will find that it will use and challenge a lot of major skills involved in creating apps.
This system should track the inventory in a hypothetical supermarket, adding items into the "back room" when deliveries arrive, allowing self stackers to "stack" and item, removing it from the backroom and adding it to the "shelf", removing an item from the "shelf" when it is purchased, etc. 

## User Stories

-   [ ] Users can create a new `delivery`
-   [ ] Users can add all items in a `delivery` to the `backup`
-   [ ] Users can select items in the `backup` to place on the `shelves`
-   [ ] Items are automatically removed from the `shelves` when something is purchased
-   [ ] Items can be `wasted` and removed from either the `backup` or `shelves` if they are out of date or damaged, etc

## Bonus features

-   [ ] Prices of items are stored and can be changed if they go out of date that day 
-   [ ] Delivery menu of incoming deliveries, their times and what will be in them
-   [ ] Different departments, e.g. fresh, home, etc
-   [ ] Audits - allow for audits which confirm that all the values are correct
-   [ ] Shoplifting metrics - Add a system that "calculates" the percentage of an item that is shoplifted (based on audits)
-   [ ] Charted sales data for analytics and performance review
-   [ ] Allow the user to find out best and worst selling items
