# E_Trial

**Tier:** 3-Advanced

Virtual trial or E-trial is an Augmented reality based e-commerce clothing app. It will be used to trial dresses vitrually with front camera. It can be used to measure body size for cloth fitting purpose.


## User Stories

-   [ ] User can try the dresses by positioning the mobile in front of them (like selfie).
-   [ ] User can measure their body parts size for accurate fitting.
-   [ ] User can reduce travel time by using this app.
-   [ ] User can use their mirror for optimal viewing of the dress trialing.


## Bonus features

-   [ ] User don't need to worry about their dress sizes while purchasing online.
