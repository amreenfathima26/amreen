# Network Speaker System

**Tier:** 3-Advanced

Why need a seperate speaker, when you have multiple phones. With Network Speaker System, audio can be amplified by playing them in multiple phones synchronously.

- This system will help us to amplify the audio from laptops and mobile phones by playing them synchronously in multiple devices. By using this system we don't need a seperate speaker.
- For developing this project, knowledge of socket programming is needed. There are no language constraints. You can use Python / Dart / C++ / Java, as long as program is capable of running in mobile devices.

## User Stories
- [ ] User can turn a audio source device to a Server.
- [ ] Other devices can connect to this server, using the IP address of the server device.
- [ ] Once connected, the server streams the audio to the mulitple connected devices with the help of socket programming.
- [ ] As the connected devices receive the streaming audio data, they are able to play the audio.

## Bonus Features
- [ ] User can create a personalized account
- [ ] User can scan a QR code to connect to the server
