# Bug Tracke System

**Tier:** 3-Advanced

A bug tracking system, sometimes known as a defect tracking system, is a piece of software that maintains track of reported issues in software development projects. It might be considered an issue tracking system.

Many bug tracking systems, including those used by most open-source software projects, allow end users to directly enter bug reports.

A bug tracking system is typically a required component of a professional software development infrastructure, and its constant use is regarded as one of the "hallmarks of a strong software team".
