# Basic-Physics-Engine

**Tier:** 3-Advanced

Today's games have amazing physics engine that might have someday made you curious as to *the behind the scenes*. It's suprisingly not that hard to make.
So today you can try to make one of your own in a language of your own choice. The goal of this project is to create a ragbody physics engine using a concept called Verlet Integration.

This concept utilizes the basic properties of vectors in physics to make ragdoll physics which u can use to make strings and cloths in your own games.

**The above project may seem hard but i encourage you to explore the topic and try to build something basic from the same**

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can add point objects that will be affected by physical mechanics (gravity, velocity, air resistance etc).
-   [ ] User can connect point objects with inextensible strings that restrict their positions
-   [ ] User can add forces to those point objects
-   [ ] User can start and stop simulations

## Bonus features

-   [ ] User can restrict position of points
-   [ ] User can control set of points with his/her keyboard
