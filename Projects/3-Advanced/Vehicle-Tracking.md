# Vehicle-Tracking

**Tier:** 3-Advanced

In today's world, everyone want's to reach their destination within very short period
of time without much bothering about the heavy traffic, availability of public vehicles
and options to reach a particular destination.

The main objective behind this app is to design a system which can track live location
of vehicles which can be used in public transport. It should give live location, time
to reach the destination, and also suggest different routes for source and destination.

## User Stories

- [ ] User can create a UI which anyone(general public) can use & understand by
      simply adding their source and destination ad choosing their mode of public
      transport.
- [ ] Live location of particular mode of public transport should be visible. For
      eg. If there is source S and destination D , with 3 buses running between these
      spots, then the public should be able to see all the 3 buses
- [ ] EAT (Expected Arrival Time) of the transport should be always there and it
      should be constantly changing depending on traffic.
- [ ] There should also be option of choosing some different route in order to reach
      the destination.
- [ ] Major focus can be given to the city bus, which are very much required on daily
      basis, and their time-table and routes should be frequently updated in the app.

## Bonus features

- [ ] User can also create a feature wheren in public can create some kind of public
      vehicle pool, and they can collaborate together to reach a particular destination.
      Such as sharing cabs,rickshaws... such feature can be implemented wherein a room is
      created in which different people who want to go to same detination by sharing means
      can join.
- [ ] Above feature can also be extended to create share my location feature option in
      the app.
