# Trigger Warning App

**Tier:** 3-Advanced

In this app you will be able to find lists of movies under a certain trigger warning label, so that you can be informed of any kind of triggering content presented in a movie you intend to watch. There is very little safe information on triggering subjects in movies and I believe that it would be a very useful app for a lot of victims of domestic violence, racism, rape, depression etc.

### Constraints

- The developer will have to initially set a list of trigger warning labels and make sure to set a considerably large database where each movie is linked to their label.
- The developer should act as moderator for the suggestions and reports.


## User Stories

- User can search a list of movies that fall under multiple labels.
- User can search for a movie and find out what are they labeled as.
- User can search for a list of movies that do not fall under any specific label.
- User can report that a movie is mislabeled.
- User can suggest to add a new label.
- User can suggest that a movie falls under a certain label.


## Bonus features

- In the future, information about tv shows (for the whole show as well as for each episode of a specific show) could be added.
