### Project: Virtual Escape Room

**Tier:** 3-Advanced

**Description:** Create a virtual escape room game where players can team up online to solve puzzles, riddles, and challenges to "escape" from a virtual room. This project combines elements of gaming, storytelling, and interactive problem-solving.

**User Stories:**
1. Users can either create a new virtual escape room or hop into one.
2. Each escape session will have a unique theme and story.
3. Voice and chat allow users to connect with each other in real-time.
4. To progress, players have to solve riddles, challenges, and puzzles that are sprinkled through the room.
5. Add a timer to put some pressure on the players.
6. Players will have no choice but to communicate with each other and work together to advance through the room
7. Whenever a player gets stuck, give them clues or hints to push them towards the solution
8. Depending on whether they escaped within the time limit or not, display a “win” or “lose” message when the game ends

**Bonus Features:**
1. Implementing multiplayer functionality could let more than a couple of players take part, which sounds fun. 
2. Having different themes and difficulty levels for the escape rooms would keep things interesting.  
3. Multimedia stuff like sounds or interactive stuff would be cool too.  Giving users the ability to make their own custom escape rooms could be neat.  
4. Maybe have a scoring system or leaderboards to see who's doing the best.  
5. Adding some kind of story that unfolds as you go through the room could make it more immersive.
