# Jira Clone

**Tier:** 3-Advanced

A clone of Atlassian's Jira app where you can manage your current tasks with the ability to create/update issues and visualize it on a simple kanban board.

This could be a great MVP (Minimum Viable Product) with either only the UI or go for a full-stack approach. I recommended use to use

- Angular/ React/ Vue for the front end.
- NestJS/ MongoDB / GraphQL for the backend.
