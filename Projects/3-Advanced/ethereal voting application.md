# A Decentralized Ethereum Voting Application


**Tier:** 3-Advanced

The decentralized Ethereum voting application allows users to create and participate in voting processes securely and anonymously. By utilizing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, the voting system ensures integrity, transparency, and resistance to manipulation or fraud.

The application is built on Ethereum, meaning thereâ€™s no central authority managing the process. Smart contracts control voting events, ensuring fairness and transparency.

## User Stories

-   [ ] As a voter, I want to cast my vote in an election anonymously, so I can make my choice without revealing my identity.
-   [ ] As a voter, I want to confirm my vote via my Ethereum wallet signature, so I know my vote has been recorded on the blockchain.
-   [ ] As a voter, I want to view the results of an election after the voting period ends, so I can see the outcome of the voting process.
-   [ ] As a voter, I want to verify that my vote is recorded on the blockchain, so I can confirm that the system accurately recorded my vote.
## Bonus features

-   [ ] Allow multiple admins or a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) to approve and create elections through a multi-signature process.
-   [ ] mplement quadratic voting, where users can allocate multiple votes to express the strength of their preferences, but the cost of each additional vote increases quadratically.
-   [ ] Enable users to delegate their voting power to another trusted voter who votes on their behalf.
-   [ ] Allow voting power to be weighted based on the number of tokens a voter holds or their stake in the system.
-   [ ] Provide a mobile-friendly decentralized application (DApp) with wallet integration (e.g., MetaMask Mobile, WalletConnect).
-   [ ] Implement a time-lock mechanism where votes are locked for a certain period before results are revealed, preventing premature vote influence.
-   [ ] Utilize zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-SNARKs) to enable fully anonymous voting, where votes are provably valid but do not reveal voter identity.
