**Every networking nerd knows about OSI Model but most of us get confused when it comes to identify the layer on which respected protocols , devies and formate in which data is trinsmitted.**


____________________________________________________________________________


**So here's my small project / App Idea to solve this problem where people can type the name of any device , protocol or any other information related to the data transmittion and in return the app will allow the usser to know the layer of OSI MODEL  on which the task is taking place.**

## App Uses 
-  [ ] Help Beginner to learn fundmental of OSI Model.
-  [ ] Deep learning of all 7 layers.
-  [ ] Identify the layer from Model on which the task is taking place.
-  [ ] Indicate the formate in which data is transfring.
______________________________________________________________________________

## Extra Fetures
- [ ] Scan Networking devices to identify them.
- [ ] Learn about every networking device after scan.
- [ ] Convert Text to ASCII Format.

_____________________________________________________________________________

## Premium Fetures
- [ ] **Learn about Networking from CCNA Certified mentors**
- [ ] **Draw Real Life networking like CISCO Packet tracer**
