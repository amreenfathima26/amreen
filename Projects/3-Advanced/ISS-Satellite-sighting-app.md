### Requirements & Constraints

- The Developer should implement a means of efficient way of loading a list of upcoming space station sighting opportunities for a user given location.
Several times a week, Mission Control at NASAâ€™s Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX, determines sighting opportunities for over 6,700 locations worldwide. 
If the user location is not listed, the user can be able to pick one that is fairly close to you. The space station is visible for a long distance around each of the listed locations.
- The Developer will need to study the NASA's Mission control center's procdures
