**Application Name:** AR City Planner  
**Tier:** 3 - Advanced

**Description:**  
AR City Planner revolutionizes urban development by integrating augmented reality technology into city planning. This project challenges developers to create an interactive AR tool for city planners and citizens to visualize and manipulate urban changes in real-time within their actual surroundings. The tool enables users to experiment with urban elements such as buildings, roads, and parks, providing a hands-on approach to planning and understanding the potential impact of their designs.

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of this application is to help city planners and citizens visualize urban development plans using augmented reality, allowing for more informed and interactive decision-making. The tool enables users to experiment with city layouts, simulate traffic and pedestrian movements, and assess environmental impacts directly in the real world, enhancing the planning process.

**Resources Needed:**
- ARCore for Android development
- ARKit for iOS development
- Unity AR Foundation for building cross-platform AR experiences
- OpenStreetMap for real-world city data
- CityEngine for urban planning and modeling
  
**User Stories:**  
- User can scan a real-world area using their mobile device to create a 3D map of the environment.  
- User can add virtual buildings, roads, and other urban elements to the scanned environment.  
- User can adjust the size, position, and orientation of virtual elements using touch gestures.  
- User can switch between different pre-designed urban planning themes (e.g., eco-friendly, high-density, historical preservation).  
- User can see real-time simulations of traffic flow, pedestrian movement, and environmental impact based on their design choices.  

**Bonus Features:**  
- User can collaborate with other users in real-time, seeing and interacting with each other's changes.  
- User can import actual city data and regulations to ensure designs comply with local laws.  
- User can generate reports on the economic, environmental, and social impacts of their proposed changes.
