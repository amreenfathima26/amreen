The Dice is a simple cube shaped like object used in various board games such as snake- ladder, Ludo etc. 
It is a simple cube which generates a random number when rolled by a user. A Dice rolling simulator is nothing but a computer model that can be created by a software program and it functions same as a normal dice in which user rolls a dice and a random number gets shown on the screen.


This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these
constraints:

-   Program should automatically declare a random number between 1-6
-   The pictures of the dice should change every time with respect to the number obtained from the randome function

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can click a button to roll a dice
-   [ ] User can repeat his turn when 6 comes   
-   [ ] User can view the dice with the number varying from 1 - 6 on it

## Bonus features

-   [ ] User can be able to change number of dices
