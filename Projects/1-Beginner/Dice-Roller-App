# Dice Roller App

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

The Dice Roller application is a simple-to-build application that sees the simulation of rolling a dice. Your task is to click on a button, which rolls the dice and generates a value from 1 to 6. It then displays the image of the dice on-screen, corresponding to the output generated from the roll. The image is updated everytime the button is clicked (dice is rolled).

This simulates the effect of a rolling a dice via the application during the absence of a physical dice.
