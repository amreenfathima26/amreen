# Tic Tac Toe

Tier: 1-Beginner

Tic Tac Toe is one of the oldest games humanity has ever known. It is so simple even a three year old could play it, yet it is somehow quite intricate. 
Making a game of Tic Tac Toe will not only teach you how to use basic data structures like arrays, but also how to use loops. In this problem you will make a game of Tic Tac Toe with three arrays.

The way you format and style the board is up to you, just make sure you use three arrays and not just one!
