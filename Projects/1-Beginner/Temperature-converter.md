# Temperature Converter

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

The purpose of the application is to be able to quickly and easily convert most common temperature scales: Celsius and Fahrenheit.  You can also add extra scales, like Kelvin and Rankine.
For a Fahrenheit-Celsius converter we need to know a formula: 
T(째C) = (T(째F) - 32) / 1.8
T(째F) = T(째C) * 1.8 + 32

## User Stories

-   [ ] User should be able to enter a number in an input field
-   [ ] User should be able to press a "convert" button and could see the results in a single output field - the  equivalent of the other scale that was entered as an input
-   [ ] If the "convert" button is pressed and the input field is empty, there should occur an error info
-   [ ] User can press a "reset" button to empty the input field
-   [ ] User can easily swap scales with pressing a "swap" button

## Bonus features

-   [ ] User can see the conversion after pressing "Enter" key
-   [ ] User can see error info after inputting letters instead of numbers
-   [ ] User can pick more scales, like Kelvin and Rankine
