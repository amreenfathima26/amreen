# Hand-Controlled Pong

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

Recreate the video game "Pong" in such a manner that you control the bar with the position of your hand(relative to the camera) instead of keyboard inputs. The goal of the user is to rack up as many points as possible, if the user misses the ball the points reset to 0.

## User Stories

- [ ] User can control the bar by moving their hand up and down
- [ ] User can customize the game settings (Bar length, ball speed, screen size) inside the game itself.
- [ ] User can pause the game at any point.

## Bonus features

- [ ] Add 2 player multiplayer where 2 people can play against each other. One half of the screen belongs to one player, the other half belongs to the other.
- [ ] Add the ability to save progress, so that the user can continue their streak from where they left off.
