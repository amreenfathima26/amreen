# DecToHex

**Tier:** Beginner 

Decimal (Base 10) is the standard counting numbers system. 
Hexadecimal (Base 16) is used for various purposes such as 
 -  assembly programming languages and in machine code. 
 -  It is often used to refer to memory addresses. 
 -  It can be used during the debugging stage of writing a computer program and to represent numbers stored in a CPU's registers or in main memory.

DecToHex lets the user enter any integer and displays its hexadeicmal (base 16) conversions. 
Its main purpose is to allow users to understand the mathmathics behind decimal to hexadecimal conversions.



This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these
constraints:

-   Since, the main purpose of the program is to allow users to understand the math behind decimal to hex conversions, the 'hex' function may not be used
