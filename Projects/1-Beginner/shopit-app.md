This could be a react application which would be beginner-friendly, and would have the most basics of a shopping web application.
The application would have login and sign up buttons.
A good homepage showing showing the products and cart, log out at the top right corner.
The database could be maintained on MongoDB.
This application would basically use  React.js, node.js, express.js, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL and Heroku for the deployment of the application.
