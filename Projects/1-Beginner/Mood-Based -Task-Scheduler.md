# Mood-Based Task Scheduler

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

**Description:** 
Mood-Based Task Scheduler is an app designed to aid users in planning their tasks based on their anticipated moods during various times of the day. The central idea stems from the understanding that mood and productivity are closely knit. With this app, tasks are not just bound by time constraints, but also by the individual's projected energy and mood levels.

**Purpose of this Application:**
The purpose of this application is to optimize productivity by aligning tasks with users' anticipated energy and mood levels, leading to improved task completion rates and overall well-being.

**Resources Needed:** 
- Basic understanding of a programming language (like JavaScript) for app development.
- Knowledge of databases for storing user profiles and tasks.
- Familiarity with machine learning or algorithms for the "learning" aspect of the app.

## User Stories
1. **User can** set up their mood profile by answering questions about their typical feelings at various times of the day.
2. **User can** input tasks they aim to complete and categorize them based on their energy requirement.
3. **User can** receive task scheduling suggestions based on their mood profile.
4. **User can** adjust tasks if their mood doesn't align with their profile at a given time.
5. **User can** track and record their moods at different times, assisting in identifying patterns or making adjustments to their routine.
