# Temperature Converter

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

The Temperature Converter is a user-friendly utility designed to facilitate the seamless conversion of temperature values between three commonly used scales: Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K). This application simplifies the process of converting temperatures and provides a valuable tool for various temperature-related calculations.

- The primary purpose of this application is to offer a quick and accurate solution for converting temperature values between different scales. It aims to eliminate the need for manual calculations and provide users with instant results, making temperature conversion more accessible and efficient.
- To successfully create the Temperature Converter application, we'll need to have a foundational understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the core technologies that will enable us to build the application's user interface and implement the necessary logic for temperature conversions. Additionally, we'll require a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of our choice to write, edit, and manage our code efficiently throughout the development process.

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can enter a temperature value in Celsius and view the equivalent values in Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
-   [ ] User can enter a temperature value in Fahrenheit and view the equivalent values in Celsius and Kelvin.
-   [ ] User can enter a temperature value in Kelvin and view the equivalent values in Celsius and Fahrenheit.
-   [ ] User can receive instant feedback if an invalid temperature value (e.g., non-numeric input) is entered.
-   [ ] User can switch between different temperature scales using a simple user interface.

## Bonus features

-   [ ] User can select a specific temperature scale (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) and convert all entered values to that scale.
-   [ ] User can round the converted temperature values to a specified number of decimal places.
-   [ ] User can choose a theme (e.g., light or dark mode) for the application.
-   [ ] User can reset the input fields to start a new conversion quickly.
-   [ ] User can easily copy the converted values to the clipboard for quick sharing or reference.
