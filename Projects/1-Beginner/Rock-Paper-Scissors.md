# Rock, Paper and Scissors

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

Rock, paper, scissors is a game we all have played IRL. Now let's use our fundamental knowledge of programming to create it in code.Loops, if conditions and a simple algorithm will be used.
Your task is to let the user input one option between rock, paper and scissors. The other opponent's option will be randomly generated from the code. Only two outcomes are possible - a draw or a win for one player and a loss for the other player.
Use an algorithm that would find the winner and restart the game.
