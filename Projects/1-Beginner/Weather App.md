Project: Weather App

Tier: 1-Beginner

Weather apps are essential tools for planning our daily activities. In this project, you will create a Weather App that allows users to check the current weather and forecast for a given location.

Constraints

You may not use any pre-built Weather APIs or libraries.
You must implement the app's functionality using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
User Stories

User can enter a location (city, state, or zip code) and see the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
User can see a 5-day forecast for the entered location, including high and low temperatures and weather conditions.
User can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units for temperature display.
User can see a warning message if they enter an invalid location.
User can see a loading animation while the app fetches weather data.
Bonus Features

User can see a map view of the entered location, with weather conditions overlaid on the map.
User can set a default location, so the app automatically displays the weather for that location on startup.
User can receive notifications for weather alerts, such as severe weather warnings or heavy rain.
