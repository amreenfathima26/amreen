# HexToDec

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

The hexadecimal is a numbering system widely used in computing. 
It is important that developers understand hexadecimal, or base 16 mathematics.

The goal of HexToDec is to practice the creation of algorithms to manage to pass from an input in hexadecimal to an output in decimal.

HecToDec allows the user to enter strings up to 4 hexadecimal digits, 0, 1, 2, etc and A, B, etc, in any order, then displays its decimal equivalent.

This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these constraints:

-   Arrays may not be used to contain the hexadecimal digits entered by the user
-   Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular hexadecimal digit in the sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can enter up to 4 hexadecimal digits in one input field
-   [ ] User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the hexadecimal number that was entered

## Bonus features

-   [ ] User can enter a variable number of hexadecimal digits
-   [ ] User can enter a negative hexadecimal number
