# Hangman

**Tier:** 1 - Beginner

The classic hangman game implemented in any language! Hangman is a very popular game which tests the players' guessing skills and vocabulary. A player is presented with a
category and a corresponding word belonging to that category is displayed as all blanks (or with just the vowels filled in, based on the version). The player guesses a letter and 
if that letter is present in the word, then all blanks where that particular letter occur are replaced. If the player guesses wrong, a line is drawn to complete the hangman figure
and once all lines are drawn / the figure is complete, the player dies or fails the game. This is the typical version i.e while playing by hand but while implementing it programmatically,
the player can be given a certain count of chances / lives to guess before dying.

-   What is the purpose of this application?
  
    The purpose of this application is to explore programming languages by implementing random word picking, validation of user input and replacement of characters. The data structures
    that could be understood with this application include strings, arrays / lists and dictionaries / maps.
    
-   Are there any resources needed in order to complete the project?
  
    The only important factor is the understanding of the game, how the validation works and the data structures you'd need depending on the language.

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can select the category
-   [ ] User can view the word in blanks
-   [ ] User can receive hint(s) regarding the word displayed
-   [ ] User can type their guess
-   [ ] User loses a chance for each incorrect guess
-   [ ] User can score points if the entire word is correct
-   [ ] User dies / does not get any points if their word is wrong or if they run out of chances


## Bonus features

-   [ ] Each incorrect guess can be modelled as a line and a hangman figure can be generated using GUI
-   [ ] Users can play with each other instead of the computer
-   [ ] User can view a leaderboard
-   [ ] Timed game
