# Invoice App

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

An invoice is a document that maintains a record of a transaction between 
a buyer and seller, such as a paper receipt from a store or online record from an e-tailer.

An invoice must state it is an invoice on the face of the bill. It typically has a unique identifier called the invoice number that is useful for internal and external reference. An invoice typically contains contact information for the seller or service provider in case there is an error relating to the billing.
Invoices are a critical element of accounting internal controls and audits.
