Caesar Cipher is an ancient codificating strategy that Roman imperators used. It is just a shifting letters process, where the user writes a message and there are some letters skips and the user sends the new codificated message. Your challenge is to create an app to codificate messages, or decodificate them.

## User Stories

- [ ] User can see an input to type his message.
- [ ] User can request how many shifts the letters will have.
- [ ] User can access his new message and add it to clipboard.

## User features
- [ ] User can decode the message .
- [ ] User can also decode the message using force (displays every combination of possible shifted message).
