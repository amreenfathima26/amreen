# Date Elapsed

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

A common question that people would ask is how many days have elapsed since a certain date. Despite this question being straightforward, the calculation is actually quite tricky; and doing it mentally or even on paper is time-draining.

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can choose a start date
-   [ ] User can choose an end date

## Bonus features

-   [ ] User can optionally choose if they want the first (or last) date to be counted as a day itself - in some calculations, we surprisingly want this feature.
-   [ ] User can opt to include/exclude weekends.
-   [ ] User can write the program as a GUI or CLI app.
