# Crypto Meme Coin Tracker

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

This is a hello world api app. Anyways we all want to see our own styles added to
a crypto price ui, and Coinbase, Gemini and BINANCE's UI isnt quite our style
so we want to develop our own, right?

### Constraints

- Since this is an easy tier project, we will not create user accounts to buy and sell,
 only GET requests to see the current price of the coins desired.
- You may use UI common components such as cocoapods, npm modules, but idealy you would
make the http request on your own.
- you must make personalized UI cards for at least 3 different cryptos, they all must have a unique color theme and other styles.

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can refresh webpage and see the latest stats for the hardcoded cryptos
-   [ ] User will see loading/error scenarios during the network events for fetching stats


## Bonus features

-   [ ] Mock axios or fetch calls with Jest and mock loading and error states to write unit tests.
