# RISCuinho - Core

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

Simulates a core for microconcrolator with the extension RV32I of ISA RISC-V implemented in almost its entirety, its goal is to create a learning platform in advanced programming for microcontrollers, using from Assembly to C (not excluding other languages like Python).

RISCuinho was synthesized using HDL Verilog and simulated with iVerilog, so for its study, testing and development the following tools are needed:

* An editor that allows you to code as Vi, NotePad++, VsCode, preferably that has highlith syntax for Verilog (you can get plugins for Vi and Vs Code.
* iVerilog Installed
* GTKWave Installed

The project is constantly expanding, and I'm working to add new extensions and tools.
the supporting ones as a graphical interface for analyzing the simulation/synthesis.

## User Stories

- Study assembly codes generated manually or by compilation of other languages.
- Study and expand your knowledge in Hardware Synthesis, especially microcontrollers

## Bonus features

- It's an opportunity for new hardware projects breaking the Arduino or ESP32 paradigm

## Useful links and resources

The project has a website where I am slowly adding study material, descriptions of RISC-V Assembly instructions, tutorials for RISCuinho: https://riscuinho.github.io

## Example projects

There are several similar projects, but none have the proposal of a learning partnership and creating a Framework for studies, see the RISC-V Collection on GitHub Explore ](https://github.com/collections/riscv-cores).
