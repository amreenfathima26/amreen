# To Do App

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

A To Do app helps remind us of tasks that we have to complete and those that are pending so that we can keep track of them. Creating such an app will take you to extend your capabilities as you can do more things in this as you develop.

You can use any language you would like to use as this project works on pretty much every modern language out there. If you are trying to learn frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [React Native](reactnative.dev/), this project will help you extend your capabilities managing states while at the same time, you can make a feature rich UI.
