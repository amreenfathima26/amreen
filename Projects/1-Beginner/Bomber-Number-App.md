# Bomber Number 

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

Bomber Number is an application based on the classic Minesweeper. Basically this would be the flow to develop:

The user must enter 9 numbers other than the one chosen by the system.

This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these
constraints:

- The system chooses a random number between 0-9
- Validate that the digits that are entered are not repeated
- Validate that the number of digits entered equals 9 before displaying a Success message.
- Validate that the entered digit is a number.
