### **Application Description**

**Purpose of this Application:**  
The **Stack Visualizer** is an educational web application designed to help users learn and understand the **Stack data structure** and its operations. The purpose of this application is to provide an interactive and visual representation of the stack's behavior, allowing users to experiment with stack operations like **push**, **pop**, and **peek** in real-time. This hands-on approach will help beginners and students better understand the **LIFO (Last In First Out)** concept of stacks and its applications in programming.

The visualizer is aimed at improving the learning experience by turning abstract theoretical concepts into a visual, interactive form. This tool can be a valuable resource for students learning data structures or developers revisiting core programming concepts.

**Are there any resources needed in order to complete the project?**  
Yes, the following resources will be needed to complete the project:

- **Frontend technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for UI design and interactivity).
- **JavaScript frameworks**: Optionally, a frontend library like **React** to build the interactive interface.
- **Graphics/Animation Libraries**: Libraries such as **D3.js** or CSS animations for smooth visualization of stack operations.
- **Code editor**: For implementing the logic and interface (e.g., VSCode or any preferred editor).
- **Basic understanding of Data Structures**: Resources like tutorials or articles on stack operations to assist with defining how the stack operates.

### **User Stories**

- **User can** visualize the stack structure on the screen, where elements are stacked from bottom to top.
- **User can** perform the **push** operation, which will visually add an element to the top of the stack.
- **User can** perform the **pop** operation, which will remove the top element from the stack, with animations showing the element being removed.
- **User can** view the **peek** operation, where the top element is highlighted without being removed, giving users a clear understanding of this operation.
- **User can** view stack overflow or underflow errors when trying to push elements into a full stack or pop from an empty stack, with appropriate messages displayed.
- **User can** clear the stack and reset all elements back to an initial state to start fresh.

### **Bonus Features**

- **User can** view the corresponding code (e.g., JavaScript/Python snippets) for each operation (push, pop, peek) performed in the stack visualizer.
- **User can** customize the input values to push into the stack and modify stack size dynamically.
- **User can** explore explanations and tooltips on hover for different stack operations, giving real-time feedback on what each operation does.
- **User can** switch between different data structures (e.g., Queue, Linked List) within the same application to understand and compare other data structures.

### **Example Projects**

Here are a few example projects that have similar functionality to your **Stack Visualizer** and can act as inspiration:

- **[Data Structure Visualizer](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html)**  
  This project provides visualizations for various data structures including stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees. It serves as a good reference for how to present operations visually.

- **[Algorithm Visualizer](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/)**  
  A platform that visualizes algorithms and data structures, including stacks. It’s a well-designed tool that showcases the use of stack operations in solving different algorithms.

- **[Stack Data Structure Visualizer (CodePen)](https://rishav123raj.github.io/StackVisualizer/)**  
  A simple visualizer for stack operations using JavaScript and basic HTML/CSS. This is a basic implementation, and you can expand it further with more interactive features.
