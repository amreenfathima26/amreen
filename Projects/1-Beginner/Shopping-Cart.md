# Shopping Cart

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

It will be a good thing to have a practice project in order to add pre-available items to a simple shopping cart. This will provide a solid foundation to the CRUD implementation on a very basic level.

This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these constraints:

-   The button 'Check Out' should remain disabled until there is no item in the shopping cart.
-   The user cannot add items in a negative manner. For example the items cannot be less than zero in any case.

### User Stories

-   [] User should be able to filter the items using a Search Box.
-   [] User should be able to add the item into the shopping cart by clicking on the 'Add to Cart' or '+' Button.
-   [] User should not be able to decrease any item less than 0.
-   [] When there are atleast 1 item in the cart the Checkout button will be enabled.

### Bonus Feature
-   [] User can manually input the number of item in the cart.
