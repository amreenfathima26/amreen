# IceBreaker

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

In training situations, the trainer is presented with the initial task of "breaking the ice" surrounding all the attendees of the training class.  This is expecially important if the attendees are going to be working together in the training class.  

One way to break the ice is to have a two truths and a lie event.  Each student submits two truths and a lie to the presenter.  Then at each break, the presenter will pick someone's two truths and a lie.  The trainer reads them out and the class votes.

This app will make the two truths and a lie game quicker to administer.  In the user stories the event is named "the game"
