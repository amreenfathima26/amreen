**Application Name:** Privacy Guardian: Smart Screen Sharing Tool  
**Tier:** 2 - Intermediate

**Description:**  
Privacy Guardian enhances the screen-sharing experience by offering real-time privacy protection. The tool integrates with major video conferencing platforms to allow users to instantly blur or unblur specific parts of their screen while sharing, ensuring that sensitive information is protected without interrupting communication. Whether sharing presentations, documents, or desktops, users have full control over what others see.

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of this application is to provide users with dynamic privacy control while screen sharing during video calls. It enables users to blur sensitive information on their screen in real-time, ensuring privacy without needing to stop or disrupt their sharing session. It is designed for professionals who frequently share screens during virtual meetings.

**Resources Needed:**
- WebRTC for real-time communication
- OpenCV for image processing and blurring effects
- TensorFlow.js for AI-powered content recognition
- Web Extensions API for browser extension development
- Electron for cross-platform desktop applications
  
**User Stories:**  
- User can install the Privacy Guardian as a browser extension or desktop application that integrates with major video conferencing tools (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams).  
- User can toggle a global blur effect on/off for their entire screen with a single keyboard shortcut during live sharing.  
- User can define specific areas or applications on their screen to always blur when sharing, regardless of global settings.  
- User can use a movable, resizable "privacy lens" tool to dynamically blur/unblur specific areas of the screen in real-time during sharing.  
- User can see a preview of what others can see, with blurred areas highlighted, in a small window during screen sharing.  

**Bonus Features:**  
- User can set up voice commands to control blurring (e.g., "blur now", "clear screen").  
- User can utilize AI-powered content recognition to automatically suggest blurring for potentially sensitive content (e.g., email clients, file names containing "confidential").  
- User can create and switch between multiple preset configurations for different sharing scenarios (e.g., work presentation, casual team meeting).  
- User can apply smart object tracking to maintain blur on moving elements (e.g., dragged windows, mouse cursor).
